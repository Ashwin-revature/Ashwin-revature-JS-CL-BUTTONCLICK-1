        /**
         * It's time to introduce JavaScript. For now, we'll think of JavaScript as a language that attaches itself
         * to an HTML file, although this will change in the future. JavaScript's main use will be in lending
         * interactivity to a site. Primarily, JavaScript will be used to manipulate elements in the DOM - the DOM,
         * standing for document-object-model, is the logical tree representation of all elements on the site.
         * 
         * Namely, in the code below, the elements with id 'text1' and 'button1' are retrieved from the DOM. You may notice that
         * these variables are defined with 'var.' Defining types are not required in JavaScript, which we'll get to
         * later. When the event 'onclick' occurs for button1, the function 'button1clicked' is executed - this works
         * because the function 'button1click' is actually being passed as a variable - already JavaScript is quite
         * different from Java!
         *
         * Be sure to test this out by opening this HTML file in your browser. As you can see with how the inner text
         * of text1 is changed, JavaScript has an easy time directly modifying the webpage in real-time.
         *
         * TODO: your next task is to replicate this functionality for button2, such that the text 'now click this button'
         * is changed to 'button 2 clicked' when button2 is clicked.
         */

        // Getting button1 and text1 HTML elements as JavaScript objects
        var button1 = document.getElementById("button1");
        var text1 = document.getElementById("text1");
        
        // Adding click event to button1
        button1.onclick = button1clicked;
        
        // Defining the click event logic for button1
        function button1clicked() {
            text1.innerText = "button 1 clicked";
        }

        // Getting button2 and text2 HTML elements as JavaScript objects
        var button2 = document.getElementById("button2");
        var text2 = document.getElementById("text2");
        
        // Adding click event to button2

        /* OPTIONAL PRACTICE: If you want more practice later, try using a button to alter text of a tag
            other than a p tag. For example, try altering the text of an unordered list. */
